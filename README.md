## 🎯 Business Problem Statement

Customer churn poses a significant threat to banking profitability, with acquisition costs far exceeding retention expenses. This analysis addresses critical business questions:

- **Who** is most likely to churn? (Risk identification)
- **Why** are customers leaving? (Root cause analysis)
- **When** do they typically churn? (Timing patterns)
- **How** can we prevent it? (Strategic interventions)

**Impact**: Reducing churn by even 5% can significantly boost revenue and improve customer lifetime value metrics.

## 🔍 Key Insights & Findings

### 1️⃣ High-Risk Customer Segments
- Customers with **1-2 products** show 40% higher churn rates compared to those with 3+ products
- **Inactive accounts** (low transaction frequency) are 3x more likely to churn
- Geographic concentration in specific regions correlates with elevated churn

### 2️⃣ Behavioral Patterns
- **Critical churn window**: 3-6 months after account opening
- Declining engagement scores are early warning indicators
- Customers with decreasing balance trends show higher churn probability

### 3️⃣ Demographic Correlations
- Age groups [specify range] demonstrate highest attrition rates
- Income-to-product mismatch indicates service misalignment
- Longer tenure customers show stronger retention (loyalty effect)

### 4️⃣ Revenue Impact
- High-value customers (top 20%) contribute disproportionately to churn-related revenue loss
- Average revenue per churned customer: [Add calculated value]
- Projected annual impact of current churn rate: [Add projection]
